# StockPile

This repository is the central place for the source code for the web version of StockPile, a DeltaHacks 8 project trying to hack for a change by providing more accessible learning environment for people interested in learning about investing. This repository was co-authored by the team members on the StockPile team on Devpost, but has been commited under the same user here.
